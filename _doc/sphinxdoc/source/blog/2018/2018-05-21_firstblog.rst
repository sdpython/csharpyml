    The main topic is machine learning with :epkg:`C#`
    introduced with :epkg:`ML.net`.
    The :epkg:`Python` is mostly here for documentation
    because that's easy.
    The module also clones the repository
    `dotnet/machinelearning <https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning>`_
    to start from the latest sources.
