    I wonder why
    but *libssl 1.0.0* cannot be installed on the dockeer image for
    `Python 3.6.5 <https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/tree/master/python/images/3.6.5>`_
    but it can on the one for
    `Python 3.6.4 <https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/tree/master/python/images/3.6.4>`_:
    `back to Python 3.6.4 <https://github.com/sdpython/machinelearningext/commit/a8017cc33d429364ae11f1ecff4dba659400fe98>`_.
    I should investigate why...
